Author: Marc Bevand

This repository is a list—as exhaustive as possible—of all peer-reviewed &
published research articles that evaluate the effectiveness of
nonpharmaceutical interventions, specifically lockdowns on COVID-19.

Papers finding NPIs effective outnumber, by 6 to 1, those finding them ineffective.

## Criteria for inclusion in the list

1. Be a **research article** (data, methods, results). Commentaries, opinion pieces, etc, do not qualify
2. Be **peer-reviewed & published** among the 26,000 titles in Scopus
3. Be **explicit**. No secondhand interpretation of figures or data tables. The
  authors must explicitly state in the text whether their results suggest NPIs
  are effective or not. Their exact words have been peer-reviewed & published. A
  secondhand interpretation has not.

## List of research articles

There are 54 research articles
* 40 papers find NPIs are generally effective (:heavy_check_mark:)
* 8 papers find NPIs are inconclusive (:question:)

  :question: "prompt interventions were shown to be highly effective at reducing peak demand for intensive care unit (ICU) beds" however the unintended consequence is that, in the absence of an effective vaccine, "when the interventions are lifted, there is still a large population who are susceptible and a substantial number of people who are infected. This then leads to a second wave of infections that can result in more deaths, but later." Vaccines being available "is not considered in the model" therefore it is inconclusive how the model applies to the real-world.
